# JamsEscape
This little game was created for GameJam in 22hours (divided for 4 days). <br>
<br>
The theme of the gameJam was timeloop. So I created this little jumping game with Jam the Pig that can stop the time. <br> In the game, you need to jump across the enemies. Jam can double jump by the calculated momentum on freezing the time in the air (by pressing space). Longer you press jump, higher Jam will jump. <br> When Jam hits the enemie, he will retun to the start and a ghost will be spawned near the dying spot.
